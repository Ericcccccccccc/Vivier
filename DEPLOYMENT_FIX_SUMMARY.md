# Google Cloud Deployment Fix Summary

## The Problem

The TypeScript API server deployment to Google Cloud Run was failing with the following error:
```
src/lib/ai.ts(1,75): error TS2307: Cannot find module '@email-ai/ai-provider' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

This occurred during the Docker build step when running `npm run build` (TypeScript compilation).

## Root Cause

The issue was with how npm handles `file:` protocol dependencies in a Docker build context:

1. The deployment script copied workspace packages to temp directories
2. Modified package.json to reference them as `file:./database-layer-temp`
3. npm install created symlinks to these local packages
4. **TypeScript couldn't resolve the module types through these symlinks in the Docker build environment**

## The Solution

Instead of trying to compile TypeScript in Docker, the fixed deployment script:

1. **Builds everything locally first** (where module resolution works correctly)
2. **Copies pre-built JavaScript** to the Docker image
3. **Skips TypeScript compilation entirely** in Docker
4. **Uses a production-only Dockerfile** that just runs the pre-built code

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Local Build Process
```bash
# Build all packages locally first
cd ../database-layer && npm install && npm run build
cd ../ai-provider-layer && npm install && npm run build
cd "$API_DIR" && npm install && npm run build
```

### 2. Copy Built Files
```bash
# Copy only runtime files (dist + node_modules)
cp -r ../database-layer/dist ./database-layer-temp/
cp -r ../ai-provider-layer/dist ./ai-provider-layer-temp/
```

### 3. Simplified Dockerfile
- Removed TypeScript compilation step
- Removed devDependencies installation
- Only copies pre-built dist directories
- Uses `npm ci --production` for faster, deterministic installs

### 4. Runtime-Only package.json
- Removed build scripts
- Removed devDependencies
- Only includes what's needed to run the server

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Faster deployments** - No compilation in Cloud Build
2. **Smaller Docker images** - No build tools or devDependencies
3. **More reliable** - Module resolution happens locally where it works
4. **Consistent builds** - Same code that works locally deploys to production

## How to Use the Fixed Script

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
cd /home/eric/PROJECTS/Vivier

# Run the fixed deployment script
./deployment/gcp/deploy-typescript-api-fixed.sh
```

## What Happens During Deployment

1. Loads environment variables from `.env.deployment`
2. Builds all TypeScript packages locally
3. Copies built JavaScript to temp directories
4. Creates a production Dockerfile
5. Submits to Cloud Build (no compilation, just packaging)
6. Deploys to Cloud Run
7. Tests the health endpoint
8. Cleans up temporary files

## Troubleshooting

If the deployment still fails:

1. **Check local builds succeed:**
   ```bash
   cd database-layer && npm run build
   cd ../ai-provider-layer && npm run build
   cd ../api-server && npm run build
   ```

2. **Verify dist directories exist:**
   ```bash
   ls -la database-layer/dist/
   ls -la ai-provider-layer/dist/
   ls -la api-server/dist/
   ```

3. **Check Cloud Build logs:**
   ```bash
   gcloud builds list --limit=5 --project=vivier-468315
   gcloud builds log [BUILD_ID] --project=vivier-468315
   ```

4. **View Cloud Run logs:**
   ```bash
   gcloud run logs read --service=vivier-api-typescript --region=us-central1
   ```

## Alternative Approaches (Not Implemented)

Other ways to solve this issue:

1. **NPM Workspaces** - Use npm workspaces in the root package.json
2. **Publish to NPM** - Publish packages to a private registry
3. **Monorepo Tools** - Use Lerna, Nx, or Turborepo
4. **Bundle Everything** - Use webpack/esbuild to create a single bundle
5. **Copy Source** - Copy TypeScript source directly into api-server/src

The current solution (pre-building locally) was chosen because it's:
- Simple and straightforward
- Doesn't require additional tools
- Maintains the existing project structure
- Easy to understand and debug
